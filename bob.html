(Uh,       I think there's a pun in there somewhere.) so I started taking guitar with       some 80-year-old guy in my neighborhood and I dropped it 'cause I didn't       like it. And, for a period of a few years, about 16 years, I didn't take       guitar again until I met Sam Davis. And Sam has brought back the joy of       playing guitar. He has taught me so much. And I'm out there jammin' and       stuff at backyard barbecues and other nefarious places. So, my hat goes       off to Sam. He knows his stuff. He is an awesome, awesome guy. Sam <i>is</i>       all . . . Knows all. Tells all. Sam is Sam. </font></td>    <td height="263" width="37">&nbsp;</td>    <td height="263" width="110">       <div align="center"><img src="bob.jpg" width="93" height="154" align="top" alt="bob yantosca"><br>      </div>      <div align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Guitar         Student</font></b></div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="268">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="37">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="110" align="right"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="test.html">back</a></font></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
